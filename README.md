# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights on the three different city types: urbal, suburban, and rural. We will be looking at different statistics such as ride count, driver count, and fares for each of the city types.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Below shows a summary of data for each of the city types.
- Urban cities have the most rides and drivers, while rural cities have the least.
- Average and total fare per ride and driver for urban cities are the lowest compared to suburban and rural cities.

Below is a chart showing total fares for each city type.
- Rural cities have the lowest fares, while urban cities have the highest.

## Summary
Based on the results, here are the recommendations addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Increase the number of drivers for rural cities. This may help decrease fares per ride and in turn increase ridership.
2. Increase the number of drivers for suburban cities. Similar to the statement above, this may help decrease fares per ride and increase ridership. 
3. Decrease the number of drivers for urban cities. There is an excess supply of drivers to meet the demand of the riders. Decreasing the number of drivers can help increase the fare per driver and balance the disparity among the cities.
